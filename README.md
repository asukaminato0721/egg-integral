# egg-integral

use [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/) with [rubi](https://rulebasedintegration.org/) to do integral.

## TODO

- [ ] select test-case
- [x] a tool to auto convert mathematica to egg rule
- [ ] benchmark

## Compare to current available tools

- open source
- rule based, easier to understand than Risch algorithm && add new rules.
- step by step
- speed
